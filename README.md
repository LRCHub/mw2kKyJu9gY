```
I am a human being, capable of
doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of
doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of
doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of
doing terrible things
There's lightning striking all
over the world
There's lightning striking all
over the world
There's lightning striking all
over the world
There's lightning striking all
over the world
Ooh
I am a human being, capable of
doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of
doing terrible things
Run
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey
You people are mistaken if you
think that I'm awake and
celebrating anything that I've
become
You people are mistaken if you
think that I'm awake and
celebrating anything that I've
become
